# nixpkgs-channels

This is our own nixpkgs-channels.
It works essentially like the upstream version, but contains a lot less branches and is built by our Hydra.
As our Hydra has a lot less jobs, the channels should bump faster than the upstream channels.

Feel free to use this, but we might do breaking changes anytime (like renaming branches).
